 * This is example code to 1) format an SPI Flash chip, and 2) copy raw 
 * audio files (mono channel, 16 bit signed, 44100Hz) to it using the 
 * SerialFlash library.  The audio can then be played back using the 
 * AudioPlaySerialflashRaw object in the Teensy Audio library.
 * 
 * To convert a .wav file to the proper .RAW format, use sox:
 * sox input.wav -r 44100 -b 16 --norm -e signed-integer -t raw OUTPUT.RAW remix 1,2
 * 
 * Note that the OUTPUT.RAW filename must be all caps and contain only the following
 * characters: A-Z, 0-9, comma, period, colon, dash, underscore.  (The SerialFlash
 * library converts filenames to caps, so to avoid confusion we just enforce it here).
 * 
 * It is a little difficult to see what is happening; aswe are using the Serial port
 * to upload files, we can't just throw out debug information.  Instead, we use the LED
 * (pin 13) to convey state.
 * 
 * While the chip is being formatted, the LED (pin 13) will toggle at 1Hz rate.  When 
 * the formatting is done, it flashes quickly (10Hz) for one second, then stays on 
 * solid.  When nothing has been received for 3 seconds, the upload is assumed to be 
 * completed, and the light goes off.
 * 
 * Use the 'rawfile-uploader' python script (included in the extras folder) to upload
 * the files.  You can start the script as soon as the Teensy is turned on, and the
 * USB serial upload will just buffer and wait until the flash is formatted.
 * 
 * This code was written by Wyatt Olson <wyatt@digitalcave.ca> (originally as part 
 * of Drum Master http://drummaster.digitalcave.ca and later modified into a 
 * standalone sample).
 * 
 * Enjoy!
